      Take my love, take my land
      Take me where I cannot stand

      You can't take the sky from me.

      Tell them I ain't comin' back

      Lost my soul, lost my dream
      You can't take the sky from me.
      I feel the black reaching out
      I hear its song without a doubt
      I still hear and I stillâ€¦
